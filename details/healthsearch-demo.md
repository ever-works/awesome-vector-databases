# Healthsearch Demo

**Website type:** Open‑source demo application / example project  
**Category:** Open-source  
**Brand:** weaviate  
**Source code:** https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo

## Overview
Healthsearch Demo is an open-source example application that demonstrates how to use Weaviate as a vector database to power semantic search over supplement products. It retrieves products based on user-written reviews and free-text queries, illustrating real-world semantic product search using vector embeddings.

## Features
- **Semantic product search**
  - Retrieve supplement products based on natural-language queries.
  - Uses user-written reviews and health-related queries to match relevant products.
  - Demonstrates real-world semantic search behavior over vector embeddings.

- **Vector database integration**
  - Built around Weaviate as the vector database.
  - Stores and searches over vector embeddings of product information and reviews.

- **End-to-end demo architecture**
  - **Backend** folder implementing the server-side logic and integration with Weaviate.
  - **Frontend** folder providing a user interface for running semantic searches.
  - `docker-compose.yml` for bringing up the full stack with Docker.

- **Health and supplement domain example**
  - Focuses on supplement products and health effects as the example dataset.
  - Shows how health-related effects and outcomes can guide product retrieval.

- **Open-source project assets**
  - `README.md` with project usage and setup details.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` tracking changes.
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` defining community guidelines.
  - `LICENSE` file specifying open-source licensing terms.

- **Hosted demo (reference)**
  - Linked live demo front-end for trying out semantic search behavior.
