## Overview

“Deep Learning for Search” is a practical book on applying deep learning to search systems. It focuses on dense vector representations, semantic search, and neural ranking, with concrete examples for building smarter search engines and applications on top of technologies like Lucene and modern DL frameworks.

## Features

- **Neural search fundamentals**
  - Explains how deep learning relates to search basics such as indexing and ranking.
  - Shows how to integrate neural networks into traditional search pipelines.

- **Improved ranking quality**
  - Techniques for achieving more accurate and relevant search result rankings.
  - Methods to handle imprecise search terms and poorly indexed data.

- **Semantic and multilingual search**
  - Searching across languages using deep learning models.
  - Translating user queries to improve cross-language retrieval.

- **Dense vector and content-based search**
  - Use of dense vector representations for semantic similarity.
  - Content-based image search using minimal metadata.

- **Recommendation-enhanced search**
  - Integrating recommendation signals into search (e.g., “search with recommendations”).

- **Practical implementations**
  - End-to-end examples using Apache Lucene.
  - Deep learning implementations using Deeplearning4j (DL4J) and TensorFlow.
  - Focus on using modern tools without requiring deep expertise in NLP or ML.

- **Adaptive and learning search systems**
  - Designing search engines that improve over time as they learn from data.

## Audience

- Developers comfortable with **Java** or a similar programming language.
- Readers familiar with **basic search concepts** (indexing, ranking, retrieval).
- No prior experience with **deep learning** or **natural language processing (NLP)** required.
