**Tags:** management, GUI, vector-stores

## Overview
VectorAdmin is a universal vector database management system that provides a graphical frontend for working with vector databases. It helps users manage, inspect, and operate on vector data across different backends, aiming to reduce time spent handling vectors and to control embedding-related costs.

## Features
- **Universal frontend for vector databases**  
  - Connects to multiple vector database backends (vector stores) through a single interface.
- **Vector data management**  
  - Organize, browse, and maintain vector collections/indexes.  
  - View and inspect stored vectors and associated metadata.
- **Inspection and debugging**  
  - Explore vector contents to understand what is stored in the database.  
  - Useful for debugging retrieval quality and vector pipelines.
- **Operational tooling**  
  - Tools to work with existing vector data (e.g., updating, deleting, or restructuring stored vectors).  
  - Helps streamline workflows around ingestion and maintenance.
- **Cost-awareness**  
  - Designed to reduce time spent “wrangling” vectors and to help keep embedding and storage costs under control.
- **GUI-based workflow**  
  - Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who prefer visual management over command-line tools or custom scripts.

## Platform
- Web-based interface (frontend for vector databases).

## Use Cases
- Managing vector stores used in LLM and RAG applications.
- Inspecting and debugging embeddings and retrieval behavior.  
- Maintaining large collections of vectors across different backends.  
- Reducing operational overhead in embedding-heavy pipelines.
