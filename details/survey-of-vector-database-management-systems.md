## Overview
“Survey of Vector Database Management Systems” is a 25‑page academic survey that analyzes the design and architecture of modern vector database management systems. It focuses on how these systems store, index, and serve high-dimensional vector data, particularly for AI and machine learning applications.

## Features
- **Comprehensive 2023 survey** of vector database management systems and their ecosystem.
- **Systematic analysis of design and architecture**, including how vector DBMSs are structured and how they differ from traditional databases.
- **Coverage of indexing techniques** for high-dimensional vectors (e.g., ANN and related vector search methods).
- **Discussion of system implementations**, describing how modern vector databases are built in practice.
- **Positioning within AI workflows**, focusing on how vector DBMSs support AI and ML applications that rely on vector search and embeddings.
- **Foundational reference** for understanding the broader vector database ecosystem, suitable for researchers, practitioners, and engineers working with vector data.
