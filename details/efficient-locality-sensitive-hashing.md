# Efficient Locality Sensitive Hashing

This work by Jingfan Meng is a comprehensive research thesis on efficient locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), covering algorithmic solutions, core primitives, and applications for approximate nearest neighbor search. It is relevant to vector databases because LSH-based indexing is a foundational technique for scalable similarity search over high-dimensional vectors, informing the design of vector indexes, retrieval engines, and similarity search modules in modern vector database systems.
