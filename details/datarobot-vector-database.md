DataRobot Vector Database is a managed vector store within the DataRobot AI Platform, designed to power production-grade vector search use cases such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and semantic search. It supports NVIDIA NIM embeddings and both built-in and bring-your-own embedding models, and can be combined with other external vector databases as part of broader generative AI workflows.

## Features

### Managed Vector Store for AI Workloads
- Managed vector database capability integrated into the DataRobot AI Platform.  
- Designed for AI workloads including:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Semantic search
  - Generative AI apps that "talk to" tabular data and documents
- Production-oriented vector search for enterprise use cases.

### Lifecycle Management
- Create, register, deploy, and update vector databases directly within the platform.  
- Treat vector databases as first-class assets within generative AI workflows.

### Embedding Model Support
- Integration with NVIDIA NIM embeddings.  
- Support for both:
  - Built-in embeddings managed by DataRobot.  
  - Bring-your-own embedding models.  
- Can be used alongside the platform’s LLM gateway to mix and match over 70 generative AI and embedding models (no separate credential management required at the application level).

### RAG and Pipeline Integration
- Built for building and running advanced RAG systems in production.  
- Can be combined in pipelines with:
  - LLMs and SLMs (small language models)
  - Retrievers
  - Prompts
- Allows creating a single unified endpoint that encapsulates LLM, vector DB, retriever, and prompt logic, callable from any application.

### Interoperability with External Vector Databases
- Ability to bring in external vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Elasticsearch) to build or augment RAG workflows.  
- Supports workflows that span both DataRobot’s managed vector database and third-party vector stores.

### Experimentation and Tuning
- Rapid experimentation across the generative AI workflow:
  - Test and compare different embedding models and configurations.  
  - Experiment with multiple chunking strategies for documents.  
  - Adjust context features (e.g., context window, retrieval settings) to optimize vector search and RAG quality.
- Prompt and model experimentation tooling to select the best-performing configuration in conjunction with the vector database.

### Evaluation and Benchmarking (Vector-Backed Workflows)
- Evaluate end-to-end workflows (including those backed by vector databases) on:
  - Faithfulness
  - Correctness
  - Latency
  - Cost
- Ability to synthetically generate large volumes of question–answer pairs across existing vector databases to:
  - Build or extend ground truth datasets.  
  - Benchmark and compare different model + vector DB configurations.

### Cloud & Infrastructure Integration
- Can participate in workflows that access GPUs across multiple clouds for inference and evaluation.  
- Designed for latency, cost, and availability optimization in enterprise generative AI workloads.
