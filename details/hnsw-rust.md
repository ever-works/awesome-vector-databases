## Description
A Rust implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm, designed for fast, memory-safe vector search in Rust-based AI, retrieval, and search systems.

## Features
- **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph implementation** for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search.
- **Fast ANN search** optimized for high-performance vector similarity queries.
- **Rust-native library** leveraging Rust’s safety and performance guarantees.
- **`serde` integration (optional feature flag)**: enable the `serde` feature to serialize and deserialize HNSW data structures.
- **Examples and benches** included in the repository (`examples`, `benches` folders) to demonstrate usage patterns and performance.
- **Tests and implementation notes** (`tests`, `implementation.md`) documenting and validating the algorithm behavior.
- **No-std compatibility checks** via `ensure_no_std` directory, indicating attention to usage in constrained environments (where applicable).

## Pricing
- Open-source under the **MIT License** (no usage fee).
