## Description
Algolia Vector Search is part of Algolia’s AI Search platform, adding semantic and similarity search on top of its search-as-a-service infrastructure. It uses embeddings to retrieve results based on meaning and context rather than just keyword matching.

## Features
- **Semantic and similarity search** using vector embeddings to find results by meaning, even when queries don’t match keywords exactly.
- **Integrated with Algolia AI Search platform**, combining vector-based retrieval with traditional relevance and ranking signals.
- **Embeddings-based retrieval** to support natural language queries and more flexible search experiences.
- **Works across multiple use cases** such as ecommerce product search, content discovery, and knowledge search (inferred from placement within the AI Search product suite).
- **Part of a broader AI stack**, alongside:
  - AI-powered Search
  - Recommendations (behavior-based)
  - Personalization
  - Analytics
  - Browse / category navigation
  - Generative Experiences and Ask AI (RAG and conversational interfaces)
