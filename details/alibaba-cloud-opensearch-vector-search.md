### LLM-Based Conversational Search
- **Conversational Search Edition** (public test)
  - LLM-based, one-stop conversational search service.  
  - Uses a built-in large language model combined with the enterprise’s own business data.
- **Dedicated enterprise conversational systems**  
  - Tailors conversation and answers to enterprise data for higher accuracy and improved data security.  
- **Multimodal conversation outputs**  
  - Returns answers that can include text, URLs, and images.
- **Fast onboarding**  
  - One-stop connection process; POC testing can be completed within about 1 hour.

### Industry-Specific Enhancements
- **Industry-Specific Enhanced Edition for E‑Commerce**  
  - Optimized for e‑commerce scenarios with higher performance, efficiency, and accuracy in product and content search.
- **Search practices for multiple industries**  
  - Integrates industry-specific knowledge graphs from Alibaba DAMO Academy.  
  - Supports vertical search scenarios such as e‑commerce, O2O, multimedia, content platforms, communities/forums, and enterprise big data queries.

### Vector & Multimodal Retrieval
- **Vector search integration**  
  - Deep integration with DAMO Institute’s Proxima vector search engine.  
  - Efficiently builds vector search services for semantic and similarity search.
- **Multimodal retrieval**  
  - Supports building vector indexes over large volumes of unstructured data: 
    - Text
    - Images
    - Audio
    - Video
    - Behavioral data
  - Retrieves content via vector similarity for improved search efficiency and accuracy across modalities.
- **Image search**  
  - Addresses retrieval over image data that cannot be effectively handled by traditional keyword-based methods.  
  - Uses vector representations instead of word-splitting recall for image similarity and related-image search.

### Search Algorithm Center
- **Model lifecycle management**  
  - Manage multiple versions of search and ranking algorithm models.
- **Continuous iteration**  
  - Iterate and upgrade models based on observed performance and business needs.
- **Training with data backflow**  
  - Train and refine models using feedback and interaction data from search usage.
