## Description

Milvus Distributed is the horizontally scalable, distributed deployment mode of the Milvus open‑source vector database. It is designed for enterprise and large‑scale GenAI workloads, providing high reliability and the ability to index and search across billions of vectors.

## Features

- **Distributed architecture**
  - Runs as a distributed vector database cluster rather than a single instance.
  - Designed to support enterprise workloads and large‑scale production environments.

- **Horizontal scalability**
  - Can scale out by adding more nodes to handle growing workloads.
  - Supports scaling to billions of vectors with minimal performance degradation.

- **High reliability**
  - Built for fault tolerance in distributed deployments.
  - Suitable for mission‑critical and always‑on applications.

- **Comprehensive deployment toolkit**
  - Kubernetes/Helm‑based deployment (per "Get Started" prereq: Helm).
  - Integrates with Milvus ecosystem tools such as:
    - Milvus CLI
    - Attu (web-based management UI)
    - Sizing tool
    - Milvus Backup

- **Vector database capabilities (shared with Milvus core)**
  - High‑performance vector similarity search for GenAI use cases.
  - Supports use cases like RAG, image search, multimodal search, hybrid search, and graph RAG.

- **Enterprise‑grade operations**
  - Designed as the most scalable Milvus deployment tier compared with Lite and Standalone.
  - Appropriate for large production datasets and multi‑user environments.
