### Description
Vector Search is Google Cloud Vertex AI’s fully managed vector search engine built on the ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) algorithm. It provides scalable, high‑performance vector similarity search to power semantic search, recommendations, and generative AI applications. It uses the same underlying technology that backs major Google products such as Search, YouTube, and Google Play, and is designed for enterprise‑grade reliability.

### Features
- **Managed vector search service** running on Google Cloud Vertex AI.
- **ScaNN‑based indexing and retrieval** for efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search over high-dimensional vectors.
- **High-performance vector similarity search** suitable for low-latency, high‑throughput workloads.
- **Scalable architecture** that can handle large collections of embeddings and growing traffic.
- **Semantic search support** by storing and querying embedding vectors from language or multimodal models.
- **Recommendation use cases** via similarity search over user/item embeddings.
- **Generative AI integration** for RAG and other workflows that require retrieving semantically similar content as model context.
- **Enterprise‑grade availability and reliability**, leveraging Google Cloud’s production infrastructure.
- **Built on the same core technology used internally at Google** for products like Search, YouTube, and Google Play.
