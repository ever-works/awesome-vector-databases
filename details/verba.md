**Vendor / Brand:** Weaviate

## Overview
Verba is a community-driven, open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It offers an end-to-end, user-friendly interface for building RAG workflows on top of a vector database, demonstrating practical semantic search and retrieval patterns using Weaviate.

## Features
- **End-to-end RAG application**: Provides a complete setup for Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows.
- **Weaviate integration**: Built to work on top of a Weaviate vector database, using it for storage, semantic search, and retrieval.
- **Semantic search**: Implements semantic search capabilities as part of the RAG pipeline.
- **Retrieval patterns**: Showcases practical retrieval patterns and best practices for building RAG systems.
- **User-friendly interface**: Frontend included (in the `frontend` directory) for interacting with the RAG chatbot and workflows.
- **Python package**: Packaged with `setup.py` and related packaging files (`MANIFEST.in`, `pypi_commands.sh`) to allow installation and use as a Python library or service.
- **Docker support**: Includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment and easy local setup.
- **Technical documentation**: Additional docs such as `TECHNICAL.md`, `FRONTEND.md`, and `PYTHON_TUTORIAL.md` for implementation, extension, and usage guidance.
- **Community-focused**: Structured as a community edition project with contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) and changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`).
- **Open source license**: Distributed under an open-source license (see `LICENSE` file in the repository).

## Typical Use Cases
- Building and experimenting with RAG chatbots backed by Weaviate.
- Prototyping semantic search applications using vector databases.
- Learning and demonstrating RAG and retrieval patterns in practical setups.

## Pricing
- **Open Source / Free**: Verba is an open-source project available at no cost under its repository license.
