## Overview

“Foundations of Vector Retrieval” is a monograph that surveys and formalizes the principles and algorithms behind vector retrieval—finding vectors most similar to a query vector in large collections of high-dimensional data. It provides both theoretical and practical foundations relevant to modern vector databases and vector search engines, covering text, image, speech, and multimodal embeddings.

## Features

- **Conceptual foundation for vector retrieval**  
  - Explains vectors as universal representations for text, images, speech, and multimodal data.  
  - Covers both hand-crafted feature vectors and learned embeddings.  
  - Formalizes the problem of retrieving vectors similar to a given query vector.

- **Focus on similarity search in high-dimensional spaces**  
  - Centers on the task of finding nearest or most similar vectors in large collections.  
  - Addresses the challenges that arise when the number of stored vectors is large.

- **Coverage of fundamental concepts**  
  - Introduces the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of vector retrieval.  
  - Lays out core ideas used in vector databases and vector search engines.

- **Advanced data structures and algorithms**  
  - Surveys specialized data structures for efficient vector search.  
  - Discusses advanced algorithms used in practice for scalable retrieval.

- **Tutorial/monograph style**  
  - Designed to be accessible as an entry point into vector retrieval research.  
  - Aims to “recap” and organize a broad body of work in one coherent treatment.  
  - Helps lower the barrier to understanding modern vector search systems.

- **Research integration and discoverability**  
  - Indexed in major scholarly tools (NASA ADS, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar).  
  - Linked to related resources via a related DOI (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-55182-6).  
  - Connected to code/data discovery platforms (alphaXiv, CatalyzeX, DagsHub, etc.) via arXiv’s ecosystem.
