## Description
vector-io is a comprehensive vector data tooling library that provides a universal interface for working with vector embeddings and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) data across vector databases, datasets, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platforms. It focuses on building, evaluating, and managing datasets and pipelines for vector databases and similarity search systems.

## Features
- **Universal Vector Interface**
  - Works as a common layer over multiple vector databases and repositories.
  - Designed for interoperability with various vector database backends and RAG platforms.

- **Vector Data Management**
  - Import existing vector data from supported databases or repositories.
  - Export vector datasets for use in other systems or workflows.
  - Backup vector data for safekeeping or migration.

- **Embeddings Handling**
  - Re-embed data using any compatible embedding model.
  - Supports workflows where embeddings need to be regenerated (e.g., model upgrades or experimentation).

- **ANN and Similarity Search Tooling**
  - Focused on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) data and similarity search use cases.
  - Aims to support building, evaluating, and maintaining similarity search pipelines.

- **Dataset and Pipeline Support**
  - Tools for constructing and managing vector datasets used in vector databases.
  - Oriented toward pipelines for retrieval, ranking, and RAG systems.

- **Ecosystem Integration**
  - Built to connect vector databases, datasets, and RAG platforms via a unified interface.

## Use Cases
- Migrating vector data between different vector database providers.
- Centralized backup of embeddings and ANN indexes.
- Recomputing embeddings when changing or updating embedding models.
- Standardizing access to vector data across multiple RAG or similarity search systems.
