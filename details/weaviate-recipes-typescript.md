**Source:** https://github.com/weaviate/recipes-ts/

## Overview
Weaviate Recipes (TypeScript) is a GitHub repository containing end-to-end TypeScript scripts that demonstrate how to use the Weaviate vector database from JavaScript/TypeScript environments. It focuses on vector ingestion, querying, and AI-oriented search workflows.

## Features
- **End-to-end example scripts**  
  - Complete, runnable TypeScript examples showing how to interact with a Weaviate instance.

- **Topic-based recipe folders** (from repository structure)
  - `agents`: Examples related to AI agents or agent-style orchestration using Weaviate.
  - `generative-search`: Recipes for generative search patterns, combining vector search with generative models.
  - `hybrid-search`: Examples of hybrid search (e.g., combining keyword and vector search) in Weaviate.
  - `similarity-search`: Scripts that demonstrate similarity-based vector search.
  - `multimodal-search/voyageai`: Examples of multimodal search with Voyage AI integration.
  - `migration`: Recipes for migrating data or schemas in Weaviate.
  - `integrations/llamaindex/llamaparse`: Integration examples with LlamaIndex and LlamaParse.

- **JavaScript/TypeScript focused setup**
  - `index.ts` as an entry point for running recipes.
  - `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` for TypeScript compilation and dependency management.
  - `.env.example` to illustrate environment variable configuration (e.g., API keys, endpoints).

- **Docker-related resources**
  - `_docker` directory with assets to help spin up or connect to a Weaviate instance for running the examples.

## Use Cases
- Learning how to connect a TypeScript/JavaScript application to Weaviate.
- Implementing vector ingestion and search patterns for AI applications.
- Exploring generative, hybrid, similarity, and multimodal search workflows.
- Testing integrations with tools like LlamaIndex/LlamaParse and Voyage AI.
- Using migration recipes as references for evolving schemas or moving data.
