# Neural Search in Action

**Type:** Tutorial / Conference Session  
**Event:** CVPR 2023 Tutorial  
**Category:** Curated Resource Lists  
**Tags:** tutorials, neural-search, vector-search

## Overview

“Neural Search in Action” is a CVPR 2023 tutorial focused on practical neural search systems. It covers how to design and implement search over deep embeddings for large-scale multimodal collections, with emphasis on:

- Million-scale and billion-scale similarity search
- Vector search engines and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods
- Using multimodal encoders (e.g., CLIP) to turn tasks into embedding-and-search problems
- How neural search supports applications like feeding context into large language models (LLMs)
- Designing query languages for real-world neural search applications
