## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, learners will be able to:

- Use text embeddings to capture the meaning of sentences and paragraphs.
- Apply embeddings for:
  - Text clustering
  - Text classification
  - Outlier / anomaly detection
  - Semantic search
- Use Google Cloud Vertex AI to:
  - Generate text embeddings
  - Build a question-answering system that combines semantic search with LLM text generation
