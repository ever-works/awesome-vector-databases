## Overview

WARP is a research engine for efficient multi-vector retrieval, targeting systems that store and search multiple embeddings per document, such as modern vector databases used for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and semantic search.

- **Type:** Research paper / retrieval engine
- **Domain:** Information Retrieval (cs.IR)
- **Publication venue:** Accepted at SIGIR 2025
- **Identifier:** arXiv:2501.17788 (cs.IR)
- **DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.2501.17788

## Features

- **Multi-vector retrieval focus**
  - Designed for settings where each document is represented by multiple embeddings (e.g., passages, chunks, or token-level vectors).
  - Targets workloads typical in RAG pipelines and semantic search systems.

- **Efficiency-oriented engine**
  - Aims to improve retrieval performance (e.g., latency, scalability) when handling multi-vector document representations.
  - Tailored to be integrated with or compared against modern vector databases.

- **Research-grade implementation**
  - Presented as a research engine suitable for experimentation and benchmarking in academic and industrial IR contexts.

- **Scholarly integration**
  - Indexed and citable via arXiv with a persistent DOI.
  - Linked to a related DOI (10.1145/3726302.3729904), enabling connection to associated SIGIR 2025 resources.
