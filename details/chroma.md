**Category:** Curated Resource Lists / Tools for RAG & LLM apps  
**Type:** Open-source vector database

## Overview
Chroma is an open-source, AI-native vector database designed as a memory and retrieval layer for LLM and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. It supports semantic, full-text, and regex search over stored data.

## Features
- **Vector database for AI applications**
  - Stores and indexes vector embeddings for use with LLMs and RAG pipelines.
  - Acts as a dedicated memory layer for AI agents and applications.

- **Search capabilities**
  - **Semantic search** over vector embeddings.
  - **Full-text search** over stored documents or metadata.
  - **Regex search** to match patterns in text fields.

- **Open-source**
  - Source code available on GitHub under an open-source license.
  - Actively developed in a public repository with multiple language components (e.g., Rust, Go directories present).

- **Ecosystem and structure (from repo layout)**
  - `clients` directory indicating client libraries or SDKs.
  - `examples` and `sample_apps` for reference implementations and example usage.
  - `docs` for documentation and guides.
  - `deployments` and `k8s` for deployment configurations (e.g., containerized or Kubernetes setups).
  - Multi-language support in implementation (`go`, `rust` directories) and associated tooling/config files.

## Typical Use Cases
- Building RAG systems that retrieve context for LLM prompts.
- Implementing semantic search over document corpora.
- Managing long-term memory for AI agents and chatbots.

## Pricing
- Chroma is offered as **open-source software** via its GitHub repository.  
- No paid pricing plans are described in the provided content.
