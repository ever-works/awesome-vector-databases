# OpenSearch Neural Search / Hybrid Search

Neural and hybrid search capability in OpenSearch that combines lexical queries with vector-based neural search using a pipeline of normalization and score combination techniques. It enables semantic (vector) search and hybrid search over indices such as `neural_search_pqa`, suitable for AI and vector database-style retrieval use cases.
